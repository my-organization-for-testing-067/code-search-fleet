# code-search-fleet

One search interface over many repositories, backed by whichever engine can
actually answer the question.

Across nine scored queries with known-correct answers, the best individual
engine gets **5/9**. This gets **9/9** — not by being cleverer, but by routing
each question to the engine suited to it and doing the few things none of them
do alone.

## Why

No single search engine answers every question about a codebase:

- **ripgrep** cannot see a route assembled from two C# attributes, and counts a
  docstring mentioning an endpoint as a caller.
- **A symbol graph** cannot see a string literal in argument position — which
  is what cross-repo seams are made of.
- **An LSP** resolves an interface to its implementation, but needs a working
  toolchain per language and minutes to index.
- **None of them** read build manifests, so none can tell you which of two
  same-named classes another repo actually depends on.

Committing to one engine means accepting its blind spot permanently.

## Quick start

```sh
scripts/bootstrap                  # install engines (--check to only report)
export FLEET_ROOT=~/code/fleet     # a directory holding your repos
scripts/verify-search              # 12 checks against a throwaway fixture fleet

scripts/cs which                   # which subcommand answers what
scripts/cs uses "/api/v1/orders"   # who uses this string, in code only
```

Every engine is optional; `cs engines` reports what is present and `cs` routes
around what is missing rather than failing silently.

## Commands

| Question | Command |
|---|---|
| Who calls/uses this endpoint, topic, config key | `cs uses <string>` |
| Which repos share this string | `cs seam <string>` |
| Any text or regex, comments included | `cs text <pattern>` |
| Where is a symbol defined | `cs def <symbol> [repo]` |
| Calls shaped like X, or taking literal Y | `cs calls '<pattern>' [lang]` |
| What implements this interface | `cs impls <symbol> <repo>` |
| What references this symbol (bridges DI) | `cs refs <symbol> <repo> <file>` |
| Which repo publishes this package | `cs provides <coordinate>` |
| Which repos depend on which | `cs deps [repo]` |

## Two levels

Built for a **fleet** directory of repos on main plus per-ticket **workspaces**
containing worktrees of only the repos being changed. Run `cs` inside a ticket
workspace and it layers that ticket's branch state over the rest of the fleet:

```
searching: PROJ-123 (2 repo(s), your branch) + fleet (8 repo(s), main)
```

Searching only the ticket would miss callers in repos the ticket does not
contain — the failure that makes renaming a shared route look safe.

## Verifying

```sh
scripts/verify-search      # end-to-end: does the facade still answer everything?
scripts/verify-engines     # per-engine: is each engine still doing its job?
```

Both matter. `verify-search` alone is not enough because **the facade hides
engine regressions**: `cs calls` falls back from ast-grep to semgrep, so
ast-grep could break entirely and the end-to-end run would still pass.

`verify-engines` also probes **known limitations**, not just capabilities, and
reports `IMPROVED` when one disappears — an upgrade can remove the reason a
tool was rejected, and nothing else would notice.

## The fixture

`fixtures/` holds five small repos (C#, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, Java) with
deliberately planted cross-repo seams **and decoys**: a prose-only mention of an
endpoint, a consumer subscribed to a topic version nobody produces, a
same-named class in an unrelated repo, a dead endpoint, a retired config key
that is a superstring of a live one.

The decoys are the point. Positive cases alone measure recall and are trivially
gamed — a tool answering "everything is related to everything" scores perfectly.
`fixtures/GROUND-TRUTH.md` explains each; `fixtures/BASELINE.md` records how
every engine scores alone.

## Honest limits

- Cross-repo, **cross-language** relations are strings. `cs uses` finds them;
  nothing resolves them symbolically. Report such links as textual matches.
- Runtime indirection — DI resolved from config, reflection, identifiers built
  at runtime — is undecidable statically at any budget.
- 9/9 on this fixture means the test set is exhausted, not that search is
  solved. The real measure is a query set drawn from your own tickets.
