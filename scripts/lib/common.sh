# Config precedence: environment > config file > defaults.
#
# The directory is `repo-fleet`, matching what `fleet-init --config` writes.
# This read `~/.config/ai-toolbox/fleet.env` until 2026-08-16 -- the path the
# tooling used before it moved out of ai-toolbox into the repo-fleet plugin.
# Nothing failed when it diverged: cs simply never saw the config, fell back to
# ~/code/fleet, and answered "nothing found" against a directory that did not
# exist. A configured fleet and a search tool that cannot see it is the worst
# combination available, because every answer is a confident negative.
#
# The config file uses `export`, so sourcing it OVERWRITES whatever the caller
# set in the environment -- the opposite of the precedence documented here and
# in the file's own header. The environment is captured first and reinstated
# afterwards, which is what makes `FLEET_ROOT=… cs …` and verify-search's own
# fixture root work. (repo-fleet's copy of this file was fixed months ago; this
# one was not, and the bug was masked by the wrong directory name above.)
