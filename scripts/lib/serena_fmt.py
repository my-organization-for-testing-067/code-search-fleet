"""Normalize Serena's JSON into the `repo/path:line: text` stream cs emits.

Every other cs subcommand emits that one line format -- it is what keeps
results compact, what makes them clickable, and what scripts/score-seams
parses. `cs impls` and `cs refs` used to print Serena's raw JSON instead, so
the two most expensive subcommands were also the two whose output could not be
scored, could not be capped, and did not match what SKILL.md promises. A single
`cs refs` on a widely used interface is a multi-kilobyte blob of
`content_around_reference` snippets, which is precisely the thing the result
cap exists to keep out of an agent's context.

Two shapes are handled, because Serena returns a different one per tool:

  find_implementations     [{name_path, kind, relative_path, body_location}]
  find_referencing_symbols {relative_path: {kind: [{name_path, ...}]}}

Anything that does not parse is passed through untouched: an error message or a
future shape should reach the caller, not be swallowed by the formatter.

Usage: serena_fmt.py <repo-name>
