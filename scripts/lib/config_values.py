"""Split a config key's sites into SET-sites and READ-sites, and compare them.

`cs fields` split a field's sites into writes and reads, and that split turned
out to be the whole value: writes observe a changed default, reads break on a
rename. A config key has exactly the same two sides -- except that they sit on
opposite sides of a REPO BOUNDARY, and nothing separated them.

`cs uses <KEY>` returns both sides in one undifferentiated list, which is the
shape that hides the defect. The interesting failure is not a missing
reference; it is a VALUE MISMATCH across the seam. The motivating finding: a
cross-repo pair, both halves unusually well verified in isolation -- the
producer proved its chart rendered identically, the consumer proved its values
parsed identically -- and the defect sat exactly between them, because the
producer gated on specific tokens and the consumer passed a group-level name
that was never one of them. Neither side's tests could see it, and nothing in
either diff could.

The asymmetry is the argument for splitting by file kind: measured across a
43-repo fleet, a Spring profile selector was in 10 manifest files and 4 code
files, a feature-flag prefix in 1 and 26, a log-level key in 15 and 58. The two
sides live in different file types, so one text sweep mixes deployment
manifests with branching code and the counts alone say nothing about whether
they agree.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY WILL NOT DO
----------------------------------
* "Accepts" is only sometimes derivable. A switch/when over string literals is
  readable; a value passed to a framework, split on a comma, or compared after
  normalisation is not. Undeterminable is reported as undeterminable, and the
  mismatch line fires ONLY when the read side is genuinely enumerable -- a
  guessed enumeration would turn this into a generator of false findings about
  values that are perfectly fine.
* A set-site's literal is often templated (`{{ .Values.x }}`, `${VAR}`). It is
  reported as templated rather than resolved, because naming WHICH sites are
  opaque is itself the useful part: those are the ones a human must check.
* The sides are told apart by FILE KIND, not by dataflow. A code file that sets
  the key at runtime reads as a read-site here, and that is said in the answer
  rather than papered over.

Usage:  config_values.py <fleet-root> <KEY>   < hits on stdin (repo/path:line:text)
Exit:   0 something was classified, 1 nothing was.
